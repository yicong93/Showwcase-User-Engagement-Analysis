# Showwcase-User-Engagement-Analysis
Showwcase is an online platform where members of the tech community connect, share their knowledge, work experiences, projects built, people they've worked with - and find new opportunities. Showwcase users can like, follow, comment, and share posts on the platform.
This project is to better understand " user engagement" on the platform through analyzing session-based data.
